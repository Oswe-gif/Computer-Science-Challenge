# Move zeroes:
The script aims to solve the problem called [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/).
* Time complexity is O(n) because iterates through the 'nums' list once.
* Space complexity is O(1)
# Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree:
The script aims to solve the problem called [2415. Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-odd-levels-of-binary-tree/description/).
* Time complexity is O(n) because we have a loop that iterates through the levels of the binary tree once (the biggest iteration).
* 
# Critical Connections in a Network:
The script aims to solve the problem called [1192. Critical Connections in a Network](https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/description/).
* Time complexity is O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges (we visit each vertex and edge once).
*
